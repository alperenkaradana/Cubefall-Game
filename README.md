# Cubefall

Cubefall is an arcade-style endless survival game developed using the C programming language and the Raylib library.

## About the Game
You control an explorer escaping from a crumbling ancient temple. Your goal is to achieve the highest score by dodging columns and stones falling from above at random speeds and positions.

* **Increasing Difficulty:** The speed of falling blocks increases as the game progresses.
* **High Score System:** The top 5 scores are recorded and saved.
* **Physics-Based Gameplay:** Collisions between the character and blocks are calculated using custom algorithms.

## Technical Details
This project was developed as a freshman Computer Engineering project and demonstrates the following technical concepts:

* **Language & Library:** C, Raylib.
* **Memory Management:** Game and player data are passed to functions via **pointers** to ensure memory efficiency.
* **Data Persistence (File I/O):** The scoreboard is stored in **Binary** format in the `rekor.dat` file.
* **Algorithms:** The **Bubble Sort** algorithm is utilized to sort the high scores.
